 Pasha is a chat bot that is designed to help during outages (Prio1s) with relaying information, improving communication and executing certain tasks. It is a Hubot modification and it was mainly inspired by GitHub's [Chat Ops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NST3u-GjjFw).
 
At Prezi, Pasha has a crucial role during Prio1 situations and it helps us a lot to reduce outage time, increase the efficiency of the communication, to alert teams and people, to find relevant graphs and logs and to create the outage report by using Pasha’s logging functions. 
 
Pasha is designed to be easily extensible. Its modules work the same way as [Hubot modules work](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/README.md#scripting).

##Pasha’s functions
   * Declare and manage a prio1s
    * start, confirm and stop
    * assign roles (leader, communication officer)
    * set and update the current status
   * Reboot servers
   * Send an outage email
   * Check and add entries to [Changelog](https://github.com/prezi/changelog) pages
   * Alert teams and people by phone/email through [Pagerduty](http://www.pagerduty.com/)
   * Update dashboards by adding, editing and removing graphs, e.g. [graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) .

##How to use/install it locally?

###Requirements

 * [Install Node] (../../wiki/Setting-up-the-Development-Environment#node)
 * [Install Redis](../../wiki/Setting-up-the-Development-Environment#redis)
 * [Configure Pasha](../../wiki/Setting-up-the-Development-Environment#configuration)

## Try it 

Run with an interactive bash adapter from Pasha's root dir: ```./run_scripts/run_bash_adapter.sh```

Run with a HipChat adapter from Pasha's root dir: ```./run_scripts/run_hipchat_adapter.sh```

Pasha also has tests. You can run the tests with this command: ``./run_scripts/run_tests.sh``

For more information, visit the [Scripts wiki page](../../wiki/Pasha-scripts)!

### Development environment

The new Docker-based development environment makes it easy to contribute to Pasha.

You will need the following tools to be installed:

- A working [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) environment
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (gets installed along with some of the Docker distributions)

To start developing, just issue the following commands:

      git clone https://github.com/prezi/pasha
      cd pasha
      docker-compose up

Depending on your Docker environment, you might need to execute `docker-compose up` with superuser privileges.

After the environment started up, open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser and register/login to the [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/) interface (default administrator credentials: `admin:admin`).

The root directory will be mounted into the Docker container and [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) runs with [Supervisor](https://github.com/petruisfan/node-supervisor), so any code change will cause the bot being reloaded.

##Documentation
We created a [wiki](../../wiki) to describe how Pasha works.
