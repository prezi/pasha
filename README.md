# Pasha

![Smart Router](doc/pasha.jpg)

 Pasha is a chat bot that is designed to help during Prio1s with relaying information, improving communication and executing certain tasks. It is a Hubot mod and it was mainly inspired by Gitub's Chat Ops.
 
 At Prezi, Pasha has a crucial role during Prio1 situations and it helps us a lot to reduce outage time, increase the efficiency of the communication, to remind us not to forget the important steps, to find relevant graphs and logs and to create the postmortem report. 
 
Pasha is designed to be easily extensible. Its modules work the same way as Hubot modules work: you put the implementation file into a certain directory and the next time you start Hubot your script will be loaded so you can easily tailor its function to fit to your need.

##Currently Pasha have these functions
   * Declare and manage a prio1s
    * start, confirm and stop
    * assign roles (leader, communication officer)
    * set and update the current status
   * Reboot servers
   * Send an outage email
   * Check and add entries to the Changelog
   * Alert teams and people by Pagerduty
   * Update dashboards by adding, editing and removing graphs
