# Pasha

![ThePasha](doc/pasha.jpg)

 Pasha is a chat bot that is designed to help during outages (Prio1s) with relaying information, improving communication and executing certain tasks. It is a Hubot modification and it was mainly inspired by GitHub's [Chat Ops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NST3u-GjjFw).
 
At Prezi, Pasha has a crucial role during Prio1 situations and it helps us a lot to reduce outage time, increase the efficiency of the communication, to alert teams and people, to find relevant graphs and logs and to create the outage report by using Pasha’s logging functions. 
 
Pasha is designed to be easily extensible. Its modules work the same way as [Hubot modules work](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/README.md#scripting).

##Pasha’s functions
   * Declare and manage a prio1s
    * start, confirm and stop
    * assign roles (leader, communication officer)
    * set and update the current status
   * Reboot servers
   * Send an outage email
   * Check and add entries to [Changelog](https://github.com/prezi/changelog) pages
   * Alert teams and people by phone/email through [Pagerduty](http://www.pagerduty.com/)
   * Update dashboards by adding, editing and removing graphs, e.g. [graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) .
